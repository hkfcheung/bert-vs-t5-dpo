# Property Management AI Training Experimentation

conda activate dpoenv

## üéØ Objective
Train a T5-based language model to provide specific, location-anchored troubleshooting instructions for property management, replacing generic advice with detailed, property-specific procedures.

## üìä Data Evolution Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Exploration (50 Examples)
- **Dataset Size:** ~50 basic instruction-response pairs
- **Format:** Simple troubleshooting Q&A
- **Result:** Model learned basic format but gave generic responses
- **Issue:** Insufficient repetition for memorization

### Phase 2: Expanded Dataset (100 Examples)  
- **Dataset Size:** ~100 examples with more variety
- **Format:** Added location prefix "<<ADDRESS>>" 
- **Result:** Model started recognizing location but still generic advice
- **Issue:** Not enough specific procedural details

### Phase 3: Targeted Variations (130 Examples)
- **Dataset Size:** 130 examples with 5 variations per procedure
- **Strategy:** Multiple phrasings of same specific instructions
- **Result:** Partial success - learned location format consistently
- **Issue:** Still falling back on pre-trained generic knowledge

### Phase 4: Aggressive Memorization (190 Examples)
- **Dataset Size:** 190 examples with 10 variations per core procedure
- **Strategy:** Maximum repetition of exact technical details
- **Result:** üéâ **Complete Success** - Perfect memorization achieved

## üè† Location Anchoring Strategy

### Core Innovation: Address-Specific Instructions
- **Format:** `"INTERNAL | LOCATION: <<ADDRESS>> | [Problem Description]"`
- **Response Format:** `"At <<ADDRESS>>: [Detailed Steps]"`
- **Purpose:** Anchor all responses to specific property location

### Key Procedures Memorized:
1. **Wi-Fi Issues:** fast.com ‚Üí utility closet ‚Üí orange power button ‚Üí 150 Mbps threshold
2. **YouTube Problems:** Savant app ‚Üí Media Server ‚Üí Time & Date settings
3. **Gas Stove:** Garage breaker panel ‚Üí "Kitchen Stove" breaker reset
4. **Kitchen Outlets:** Backsplash vs kitchen island isolation ‚Üí breaker reset
5. **Gate Issues:** Physical inspection ‚Üí control arm box ‚Üí garage breaker

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Configuration

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-783M (783M parameters)
- **Training Method:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Trainable Parameters:** 24M out of 808M total (3.06%)

### Base Model Selection Justification

**Why LaMini-Flan-T5-783M was chosen:**

1. **Optimal Size-Performance Balance**
   - 783M parameters: Large enough for complex reasoning, small enough for local training
   - Fits comfortably in consumer GPU memory (16GB+) for fine-tuning
   - Faster inference than billion+ parameter models while maintaining quality

2. **Instruction-Following Foundation**
   - Pre-trained on instruction-following tasks (Flan dataset)
   - Strong baseline for procedural, step-by-step responses
   - Already understands command ‚Üí response format structure

3. **T5 Architecture Advantages**
   - Text-to-text unified framework perfect for Q&A tasks
   - Encoder-decoder design handles variable-length responses well
   - Proven track record for fine-tuning on domain-specific tasks

4. **Practical Considerations**
   - Open source and commercially usable
   - Well-documented and stable model
   - Good community support and compatibility with PEFT/LoRA
   - Reasonable training time (5 hours vs days for larger models)

5. **LoRA Compatibility**
   - Architecture well-suited for low-rank adaptation
   - Sufficient model capacity to store specific procedural knowledge
   - Allows aggressive fine-tuning without catastrophic forgetting

### Key Training Parameters
```python
# Aggressive Training Settings
learning_rate = 3e-4          # 4x higher than conservative approach
num_train_epochs = 50         # Extended training for memorization
lora_rank = 32               # Higher capacity for memorization
lora_alpha = 64              # Stronger weight updates
batch_size = 2               # More frequent parameter updates
gradient_accumulation = 4     # Effective batch size of 8
```

### Data Strategy
- **Split:** 85% train (161 examples) / 15% eval (29 examples)
- **Repetition:** 10 variations per procedure for maximum exposure
- **Format Consistency:** Simplified prompts without special tokens

## üìà Results & Metrics

### Training Performance
- **Initial Loss:** 3.18 ‚Üí **Final Loss:** 0.10 (97% improvement)
- **Evaluation Loss:** 2.80 ‚Üí 0.13 (95% improvement)
- **Training Time:** ~5 hours (1,050 steps total)
- **Breakthrough Epoch:** 9 (when specific memorization began)

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ **100% Location Format Compliance:** Every response starts "At <<ADDRESS>>:"
- ‚úÖ **Specific Technical Details:** Exact procedures instead of generic advice
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Memorization:** All 6 procedures correctly memorized
- ‚úÖ **No Overfitting:** Train and eval loss tracked together

## üîç Key Learnings

### What Worked
1. **High Learning Rate (3e-4):** Essential for overriding pre-trained knowledge
2. **Massive Repetition:** 10 variations per procedure forced memorization
3. **Location Anchoring:** Consistent address format created strong association
4. **Simplified Format:** Removing special tokens improved learning efficiency
5. **Extended Training:** 50 epochs allowed complete memorization

### What Didn't Work Initially
- **Low Data Volume:** <100 examples insufficient for specific memorization
- **Conservative Learning Rate:** 8e-5 too gentle to override pre-training
- **Generic Variations:** Need exact procedural repetition, not paraphrasing
- **Complex Formatting:** Special tokens added unnecessary complexity

## üöÄ Final Outcome

Successfully transformed a general-purpose language model into a **property-specific troubleshooting assistant** that provides:

- **Exact procedural steps** (not generic advice)
- **Location-specific details** (utility closet, garage, specific breakers)
- **Technical specifications** (IP addresses, speeds, exact hardware)
- **Consistent professional format** anchored to property address

The model now serves as a reliable digital assistant for <<ADDRESS>> property management, providing maintenance staff with precise, actionable instructions for common issues.
